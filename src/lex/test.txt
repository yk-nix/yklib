 (CNN)Crown Prince Naruhito, who on Wednesday ascends the Chrysanthemum Throne to become Japan's 126th emperor, has pledged to bring the world's oldest monarchy closer to the people.
In February he explicitly vowed to continue his father's legacy, particularly in breaking down the barriers between the emperor and his subjects.
"I want to earnestly fulfill my duties by always being close to the people, and sharing with them their joys and sorrows," he said.

Hironomiya Naruhito Shinno, better known as Crown Prince Naruhito, was born in Tokyo in February 1960, the eldest child of Emperor Akihito who abdicated Tuesday and his wife Michiko.
Those who know Naruhito, describe him as "modest, charming and astute," says Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asian Studies at Temple University in Japan.
